# Esoteric progamming languages

Over the years I have written several implementations of "esolangs". They are programming languages invented just for fun.

## Technologic

##### Unique factor: Afaict, the first and only interpereter for this theoretical language.

Technologic is an esolang based on the lyrics of the classic [Daft Punk track](https://genius.com/Daft-punk-technologic-lyrics). It was drawn up as a theoretical joke, and I wrote the first real implementation for it.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/Technodelogic).

## Omgrofl

##### Unique factor: Afaict, I wrote the first FizzBuzz implementation for this language.

Omgrofl is an esolang based on haxx0r slang. These days, there aren't many remaining interpreters. As far as I can tell there was only one other project that wasn't a dead link when I started writing it - this language may be somewhat dying out.

As part of a competition for writing unique FizzBuzz programs, I wrote the first FizzBuzz program in omgrofl alongside my Rust-based interpreter.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/omgrofl-rs).

## Thue

##### Unique factor: First implementation in Rust.

Thue is an esoteric language based on string manipultation. It's a very fun & very different langauge.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/thue).

## AQA Assembly

##### Unique factor: Likely the most complete IDE for this rare language

This program edits & interprets the made-up assembly language speculated about in AQA A-Level exam papers in the UK. It may be useful for practising mock papers etc.

It features a proper editor with syntax-highlighting, memory + register inspection, and a program-counter indicator.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/aqa-assembly).

## Brainf\*ck

##### Unique factor: x86-64 go _zooooom_

This one is fun. Lots of these.

| Type                     | Link                                              | Relative speed |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Javascript Interpreter   | [Here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/brainfJSk)   | 1x             |
| Go Interpreter           | [Here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/brainGoop)   | 8x             |
| Rust Interpreter         | [Here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/brainfrsk)   | 9x             |
| Rust -> x64 ASM Compiler | [Here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/brainfrsk-2) | 36x            |

## Kaffee

##### Unique factor: Made up the lanugage myself

Kaffee is a langauge I invented based on an idea for a version of Javascript without its confusing grandfathered-in features and outdated, unchangeable APIs.

It is a garbage-collected, dynamically-typed language with an interpreter written in Rust.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/kaffee).

## SuperBAS

##### Unique factor: Made up the language myself

SuperBAS ("Superset of BASIC") is a programming language for modern computers based on 80s-era home computer BASIC. It allows people with hobby programming experience from computers like the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro or Commodore 64 to write programs for Windows, macOS and Linux PCs.

There are also syntax-highlighting packages available for [Atom](https://github.com/adamsoutar/atom-language-superbas) and [VS Code](https://github.com/adamsoutar/vscode-language-superbas).

You can find it [here](https://github.com/adamsoutar/SuperBAS).

## C

##### Unique factor: A unique ability to mimic undefined behaviour in valid programs via the compiler developer's own incompetence.

Okay, C isn't exactly an esoteric language, but using it does cause a similar amount of discomfort to writing Malbolge.

I wrote a C compiler.
